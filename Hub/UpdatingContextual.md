# Updating Contextual

Contextual is simply an iframe that you control just like in the MicroApp. Hub expects that you have your views hosted at:

```
https://mySuperCoolApp.com/microapp
https://mySuperCoolApp.com/contextual
```

NOTE: You can set all urls for your application but these are the defaults. The develop portal will support this with the next release.
