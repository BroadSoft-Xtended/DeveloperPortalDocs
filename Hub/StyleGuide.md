# UC-One Hub API - Best Practices

For a Hub app to be approved it must be submitted to the Hub UI team for approval.  While we provide developers the creative liberty to build a UI that they believe will be welcomed by their user based, we ask that you consider the Google material design as a guide as you follow the style guidelines as prescribed below.   If the UI doesn’t followed modern web standards, like Google’s Material design, then there’s a strong likelihood that the design will be pushed back for remediation.

## Typography

Text should be understandable by anyone, anywhere, regardless of their culture or language. Clear, accurate, and concise text makes interfaces more usable.

Open Sans is the standard typeface for UC-One Hub, the font stack should specify Open Sans, Arial, and then sans-serif.

## Other User Interface Elements not Discussed

Your application may have several other types of widgets and tools in order to improve the user experience. This section will be updated as needed with a standard on those types of tools and we are fully willing to work with you to make your application the best it can be. The goal of this section is to have a standard way of doing things for all Hub apps in order to present the user with consistent results.
